        <p class="about-content" id="intro">We are a family owned and operated business. We founded this business because we wanted to show people how simple it is
        to see their property from a new and beautiful perspective. JC Drone Services offers a cutting edge
        photography/videography option for our clients to show the beauty and function of their property with less cost, greater
        convenience and quicker results than a traditional photographer or manned aircraft can offer. We believe in giving our
        clients access to high quality photography and videography from a new perspective with excellent customer service.</p>
        
        <p class="about-content" id="jon">Jonathan Chrisman, our CEO and Lead Pilot, is a Certified FAA Remote Pilot and has his North Carolina Commercial Drone
        Operator Permit as well (an additional permit is not required in South Carolina). He has training in GIS, data
        collection and photography. This is Jonâ€™s second career, he began his career in the medical field while he attended
        college and earned his Associates of Science. He changed careers 8 years later to pursue his true calling, aviation. Jon
        was one of the first people in the world to graduate with a BS in Unmanned Aircraft Systems from Letourneau University.</p>
        
        <p class="about-content" id="kayla">Kayla Chrisman, our COO, has a diverse background as well. She graduated from Houston Baptist University with a BA in
        Elementary Education. She is a former elementary school teacher and spent 2 years in administration managing multiple
        facilities and employees. She also started her own small business a few years ago, an Etsy shop named Wildflower Hills
        Company. Throughout her 10 years in the professional world, her creativity, attention to detail and management style has
        made her a valuable asset to our team.</p>
        
        
        <p class="about-content" id="outro">We look forward to working with you soon and showing you our photography, on a higher plane.</p>
