        <p class="page-content" id="intro-about">We are a family owned and operated business. We founded this business because we wanted to show people how simple it is
        to see their property from a new and beautiful perspective. JC Drone Services offers a cutting edge
        photography/videography option for our clients to show the beauty and function of their property with less cost, greater
        convenience and quicker results than a traditional photographer or manned aircraft can offer. We believe in giving our
        clients access to high quality photography and videography from a new perspective with excellent customer service.</p>
